  - Welcome to Deaf Deaf World! This is an event designed to teach visitors various
    forms of nonverbal communication.
  - "You\u2019ll be tasked with completing a checklist of seemingly straightforward
    tasks without using your voice."
  - You may struggle to complete these tasks, but we hope that this struggle helps
    you empathize better with the struggles Deaf and hard of hearing individuals
    may face in their daily lives.
  - So! Here's your list of tasks for the day, and you can start by heading to the
    Travel Agency on the left side of the park.
  - Once you've completed all your tasks, come meet me in Town Hall on the far side
    of the park for congratulations!
